                <h3 class="header-spacing">What are Version Control Systems(VCS)? </h3>
                <p>Version Control Systems, also can be known Revision Control Systems or Source Control Systems, are software tools that tracks and manages changes to repositories(fancy name for a collection of files). A VCS also gives teams collaborative tools to share and integrate any changes made to every member of that team. When a VCS is being used, it will track additions, deletions, and modifications applied to any files and directories(fancy name for folders).</p>
                <h3 class="header-spacing">Why use a VCS?</h3>
                <p>VCS is an essential tool that helps software development teams collaborate, because in most cases, a software project will include more than one developer working it. However, even if a developer was working on a projects alone, there are still many benefits from using a VCS, so in short there really is no reason not to use a VCS.</p>

                        <h4>Conflict resolution</h4>
                        <p>No, not that type of conflict resolution but, merge conflict resolution. While a team is developing a project, there may be times where more than one person will need to make changes to the same file at the same time. This can potentially create conflicts if the developers write different lines of code on the same lines. A VCS will track the changes each developer made and help resolve these conflicts between the developers files to synchronize them.</p>

                        <h4>Versions</h4>
                        <p>As you might have guessed, a VCS gives teams the ability to create versions of their projects. There are a couple benefits to this. It provides development teams the ability to "undo" per say by rolling back to previous working versions of the project just in case the current version does break the code. It also gives teams a system to track the history of changes made to the source code throughout the project timeline.</p>

                        <h4>Backup</h4>
                        <p>When a development team decides to use a VCS, they also able to host a remote version of their project online, with a service such as Github. In doing this, if something were to happen a a developer's computer, they still would have a backup of their code online, ready to pull down onto a new computer.</p>

                <p>Git is vital for developers today, because of one simple word, collaboration! Git allows many
                    developers to clone a repository or "repo" from a main codebase down to 
                    their machines, work separately on portions of code, and then commit their changes back to the 
                    main codebase where everybody can update the new changes.

                <p>think of git commits, as a snapshot of your certain project at a given point in time, they arent

                <p>Now depending on whether youve pushed up to your branch before will vary how you use the git push

                <p>If you've never pushed to your branch before the command you will use is:</p>

                <p>This command does a couple things, one it's pushing your commits made up to your remote, and then
                    the "-u" is linking the local branch with the remote version of the branch</p>
                <p>However, lets say you have already pushed to this branch before and you just need to push new

            without conflicting with each other.
        </p>
        <p>Git lets developers have as many branches active as they want, and they can all be worked on independently from one another
            until they want to merge them back together
        </p>
        <p>So far we have only worked on one <span class="cmd-font">branch</span> called <span class="cmd-font">master</span>. 
            This branch is created by default by git.

                <p>By using the command: <span class="cmd-font">git branch</span>, it will output a list of branches currently in the repo,
                    what branch you're on, and asterisk where the HEAD is.
                </p>
                <p>To create a new branch using <span class="cmd-font">git branch</span> you can use the command below:</p>
                <p class="cmd-text"> git branch development</p>
                <p>Below is an example of using git branch to list branches and creating a new branch:</p>

                <h3 class="cmd-text header-spacing">git checkout</h3>
                <p>Lets assume you already created a new branch called, <span class="cmd-font">exampleBranch</span>, 
                    in order to switch to that branch, you'd use the command:
                </p>
                <p class="cmd-text">git checkout exampleBranch</p>
                <p>You're now on the branch called, <span class="cmd-font">exampleBranch</span>, but what if from here you want to go back to another branch? You'd use the same
                    command except switch out the branch name for the branch you would like to switch to, like below:

        <p>Now that we know how to create branches, and switch to branches, there is a shortcut to create a new branch 
            and immediately switch to it. The command is:
        </p>
        <p class="cmd-text">git checkout -b "branchName"</p>
        <p>Here's an example of the command in use, and switching back to the original branch i was working on:</p>

                <p>The <span class="cmd-font">git status</span> command is a relatively simple command. It just shows you what's been happening with <span class="cmd-font">git add</span> and <span class="cmd-font">git commit</span>.</p>
                <p>It lists which changes have been tracked,staged/not staged by git, what branch you're on, and if your remote has updates you need to pull down.</p>
                <p>Below is an exmaple, and shows that my current changes are not staged:</p>

                <p>It is best practice to check that state of your repo before you begin working on your projects, this will prevent you working on outdated code, or accidentally committing a portion of code you didn't mean to.</p>

                <h3 class="cmd-text header-spacing">git log</h3>
                <p>The <span class="cmd-font">git log</span> command displays your commit snapshots.</p>
                <p>It will let you see your project history, filter through it, and even search for specifc changes.</p>
                <p>The main difference between <span class="cmd-font">git status</span> and <span class="cmd-font">git log</span> is <span class="cmd-font">git status</span> 
                    lets you inspect your working directory and staging area, while <span class="cmd-font">git log</span> only works for committed history.
                </p>
                <p>If your <span class="cmd-font">git log</span> takes up more than terminal screen, you can scroll down with your space, arrow keys, or mouse scroll. To exit your 
                    <span class="cmd-font">git log</span> simply just press "q".
